<b>Challenge Description:</b><br>
The "Buffer Overflow 0" challenge in PicoCTF involves binary exploitation. Participants must analyze the given binary executable to identify and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to retrieve the flag.

<b>Exploitation:</b><br>
On opening the source code, we see that on line 40, the gets() function is called, and reads buf1 onto the stack. This function writes the user’s input to the stack without regard to its allocated length. The user can simply overflow this length, and the program will pass their input into the vuln() function to trigger a segmentation fault.
