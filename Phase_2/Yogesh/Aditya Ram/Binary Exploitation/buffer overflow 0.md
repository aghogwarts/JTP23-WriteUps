# buffer overflow 0

1) I first opened the source code provided in the question and analysed it.
2) I saw there was a variable buf1 which is inputted by the user and is then sent to the 'vuln' function.

3) The maximum length of buf2 is 16 and the question is all about overflowing the stack.
4) So i then ran the program on the shell and when i entered a string more than 16 characters the stack overflowed and the flag came as the output.
