## Macrohard Weakedge  
Okay, SO for this one, I first converted the pptm file into a zip file(def rem about the bin file ques from the cryptic hunt).  
Then I just started to look into every folder just to find the file real quick and found a bin file, but I ended up wasting a hell lot of time on it just to know that no flag exists inside it.  
Then, tired of it, I tried to look into other files and folders and then I found this which very likely was to contain the flag!.

_The hidden file was looking like a ray of hope and I ended up opening it and guess what I cracked it!_

I found this spaced text, then I tried to think about what can be done, and as usual, Base64 came to my mind first, I removed all the spaces in the text and using CyberChef(Godly Website), i decoded the Base64 to ASCII format and got the flag _picoCTF{D1d_u_kn0w_ppts_r_z1p5}_
