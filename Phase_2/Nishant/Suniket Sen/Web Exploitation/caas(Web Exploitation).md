So this one was the easiest challenge given under web exploitation.  
First I tried to look into the the _index.js_ file given to examine for the flag but soon realised there was no req for it.  
Then I tried to _curl_ the webpage in my Linux terminal and tried to list the files and directories in the backend using _ls_  
Then I witnessed the presence of a sussy file "falg.txt".  
I used _cat_ on it and thus got the flag.  
the flag is _picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}_
