### Approach Used
* Firstly when we go to the website and directly inspect or check the source we won't find anything special.

* So we will try to login with a random username and password and hence get login failed, which in turn will give us two files 'secure.js' and 'login.php'. And if we enter the 'secure.js' file we can see the username and password.

* Now we will just login from the username and password given in 'secure.js' and we will instantly get the flag.
