Looked around in the code but i did not find any clue (my coding skills a beginner level)  
I connected to the net cat channel in another terminal and tried the two options.  
Eventually i had to refer to a writeup 'https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/blob/main/Binary%20Exploitation/Stonks/Stonks.md#hints'  
So i choose 1 and ask for pointers data by %p.

Using just 1 %p i get only 7 values from x as hexadecimal. So i use alot of %p.

This time i get the hecadecimal output '0xa0123700x804b0000x80489c30xf7ed1d800xffffffff0x10xa0101600xf7edf1100xf7ed1dc7' and which there is a nil.  
Converting to ASCII using 'https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-ascii-text-converter'  
the conversion was not giving anything useful so i tried the other half after the nil.  
```
0x991a3b00x804b0000x80489c30xf7f41d800xffffffff0x10x99181600xf7f4f1100xf7f41dc7(nil)0x99191800x40x991a3900x991a3b00x6f6369700x7b4654430x306c5f490x345f74350x6d5f6c6c0x306d5f790x5f79336e0x326663310x306131300xffd3007d0xf7f7caf80xf7f4f4400xbbf36f000x1(nil)0xf7ddece90xf7f500c00xf7f415c00xf7f410000xffd371a80xf7dcf68d0xf7f415c00x8048eca0xffd371b4(nil)0xf7f63f090x804b0000xf7f410000xf7f41e200xffd371e80xf7f69d500xf7f428900xbbf36f000xf7f410000x804b0000xffd371e80x8048c860x99181600xffd371d40xffd371e80x8048be90xf7f413fc
```
Converting the value after nil gave me the flag but in a weird pattern.
After removing the unreadable character the flag was 'ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n2fc10a10}'  
This seems like an Endian with a block of 4 characters so i fixed it and got the correct flag.  
Flag picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_1cf201a0}  
## Challenge: Babygame01  
Opened net cat in one terminal and the file in the other.

Winning the game did not give me the flag.  
Referred 'https://github.com/noamgariani11/PicoCTF-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Binary%20Explotation/babygame01/babygame01.md'
Move to the top left corner and then 4 spaces left to get flag 64 
Then moved towards x as the flag changed to 46 (endian?)
and got the flag.  
Flag: picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabl...8e6}

## Challenge Buffer Overflow 0  
Downloaded both the files via wget and open netcat in another terminal.  
The netcat terminal asked for an input which i did not have.  
Looked at the source code but had no clue so i referred a writeup 'https://programmingfire.com/picoctf-2022-binary-exploitation-buffer-overflow-0'  
I learnt about the segmentation fault error as well the as vulnerability associated with gets function.  
Thats it!!! In order to get the flag all i must do is overflow the input with overly long length text.  
Doing so gave me the flag.  

flag: picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
